# Creating Scatter Plots in Excel

## Overview
Tutorial on creating, formatting, and evaluating scatter plots to visualize relationships between paired variables.

**Worksheet:** 1.8 Scatter Plot (Scientific Thinking Excel Tutorial Workbook)

## Purpose of Scatter Plots

**Use Cases:**
- Identify relationships/correlations between paired variables
- Visualize data patterns difficult to see in tables
- Make predictions about future events
- Understand biological systems even without complete knowledge

**Example Variables:**
- Body mass vs. blood alcohol level
- Study time vs. exam performance

## Creating a Scatter Plot

### Basic Steps
1. Highlight both variable columns (e.g., F2:G33)
2. Go to **Insert** tab → **X Y (Scatter)** button
3. Choose first Scatter option

### Convention
- **X-axis (horizontal):** Independent/predictive variable (first column)
- **Y-axis (vertical):** Dependent/response variable (second column)

## Formatting the Plot

### Add Title
1. Click "Chart Title"
2. Replace with descriptive title (e.g., "Average Study Time vs. Exam 1 Scores")

### Add Axis Labels
1. Click chart → **Chart Design** tab
2. **Add Chart Element** → **Axis Titles** → **Primary Horizontal**
3. Repeat for **Primary Vertical**
4. Label X-axis (e.g., "Average Study Time (hrs/wk)")
5. Label Y-axis (e.g., "Exam 1 Scores")

### Adjust Axes Ranges
**Y-Axis:**
1. Right-click Y-axis → **Format Axis**
2. Set **Bounds:** Minimum = 35, Maximum = 105
3. Set **Units:** Major = 5

**X-Axis:**
1. Right-click X-axis → **Format Axis**
2. Set **Units:** Major = 0.5 (for easier reading)

## Evaluating the Scatter Plot

### Questions to Ask
1. **Is there a trend?** (upward, downward, or none)
2. **Is the relationship consistent?** (do most points follow the trend)
3. **Does the relationship make sense biologically/logically?**

### Example Interpretation
- **Observed:** Upward trend from left to right
- **Meaning:** As study time increases, exam scores increase
- **Consistency:** Most data follows this trend
- **Logic:** More studying → better performance (makes sense)

## Next Steps
- Quantify the relationship so everyone can agree
- Use the relationship to make predictions
- Apply linear or nonlinear regression models
