**Lab Instructions: Scientific Reasoning Act II Mission Memo**

Greetings Fellow Explorer: 

The temperature of Phygaris continues to rise with the passing of the season. The baby astelars are now experiencing higher temperatures than they would in a typical breeding season. Trapped in their eggs, they have no way to avoid the rising temperatures.

We can choose to do nothing and hope they survive. Alternatively, we can intervene by moving the eggs to a cooler beach. However, a decision of this magnitude should not be made lightly; we must use evidence to choose the better option.

With the help of your fellow explorers, you measured temperature, water, and oxygen at a second beach—close to the beach where the astelars laid their eggs. At the same time, I deployed a research drone to measure the same variables at the first beach. The data will enable you to predict the probability that an egg would hatch on each beach. 

In addition to the physical conditions of the beaches, we should consider any biological threats to the astelars. At the second beach, we discovered not only red tippers but also digworms. These large, burrowing creatures might crush the astelar eggs while moving through the sand. By combining our knowledge of the physical conditions with our knowledge of the biological conditions, we can decide whether to leave the eggs at their current location (Beach 1\) or move them to the other location (Beach 2).  

Use the following questions to guide your work:

* Would more eggs hatch under the physical conditions on Beach 1 or under the physical conditions on Beach 2? (Appendices 1 and 2\)  
* Considering the physical and biological conditions of each beach, should we leave the eggs at Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2? (Appendix 3\)

Universally in your debt,

**The AI**

**Note:** You will be using the program Microsoft Excel for this assignment. We have provided links to Excel tutorials and transcripts where applicable, to help you answer the questions.

# **Appendix 1**

## **Would more astelars hatch at mean temperature of Beach 1 or at the mean temperature of Beach 2?**

At least 381 astelar pups must survive each year to keep the population from shrinking. This season, only 2217 eggs were laid, which means that 17.2% of the astelars in these eggs must hatch and enter the sea. Whether or not we decide to move the eggs, the wrong decision could cause the extinction of the astelars. 

On Earth, many variables affect the probability that an egg will hatch, including the temperature, oxygen concentration, and water concentration of the surrounding environment. For this reason, parents lay their eggs in places where these conditions enable their offspring to survive. Even small deviations from ideal conditions can kill an embryo before hatching—a catastrophe we must avoid in the Intergalactic Wildlife Sanctuary. 

You measured temperatures at two beaches: the beach where astelars laid their eggs (Beach 1), and a beach to which we might move those eggs (Beach 2). First, we will explore how temperature affects the probability that an egg will hatch, also called *hatching success* (%). Then, we will determine which beach has temperatures that should enable more eggs to hatch. 

The following steps will enable us to answer the question "Would more astelars hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 1 or at the mean temperature Beach 2?":

**Step 1: Anticipate your analysis**: Determine what you should observe if the temperature on Beach 1 or Beach 2 was better for astelars. This step will help us identify the evidence we need to build an argument in Step 3\. 

**Step 2: Predict whether more astelars will hatch at the mean temperature of Beach 1 or at the mean temperature of Beach 2**: Use the temperatures of each beach to predict hatching success. First, we will use data for past breeding seasons to relate hatching success to the mean temperature. Then, we will estimate the mean temperature of each beach in the current breeding season. Finally, we will use the linear relationship between temperature and hatching success to predict the hatching success in the current breeding season. This step provides the evidence needed to build an argument in Step 3, when we will conclude whether the mean temperature of Beach 1 or Beach 2 would enable more astelars to hatch.

**Step 3: Weigh the evidence and conclude whether the mean temperature is better for astelar eggs on Beach 1 or Beach 2**: Construct an argument to answer the question “Would more astelars hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 1 or at the mean temperature Beach 2?” Your argument should draw on your calculations in Steps 1 and 2\.

To construct a sound argument, one must anticipate the evidence needed to support a claim. For Appendix 1, you can choose between two claims: **1\)** more astelars will hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 1 than at the mean temperature on Beach 2; or **2\)** more astelars will hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 2 than at the mean temperature on Beach 1\. 

To determine which claim is better supported, we must know the relationship between temperature and hatching success. Relationships enable us to predict how the value of an independent variable affects the value of a dependent variable, such as how temperature affects hatching success. Step 2 of this appendix explains the mathematics and interpretation of a linear relationship. But first, we’ll use our general understanding of linear relationships to anticipate the evidence needed to support each of the potential claims. 

In each of the figures below (A-C), the y-axis represents the hatching success (%), with higher values indicating a higher probability of hatching. The x-axis represents the temperature of the sand, with higher values indicating a higher temperature. The solid black line represents a hypothetical linear model of the relationship between temperature and hatching success. The mean temperature of each beach is marked by an arrow pointing to the x-axis.

Excel tutorial:

* [\#9 Analyzing Linear Relationships](https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/221276/pages/excel-tutorial-9); [\#9 Analyzing Linear Relationships transcript](https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/221276/files/113150235?wrap=1)

Because Beach 2 is cooler than Beach 1, we might expect more astelars to hatch if we move the eggs. But how many more astelars would hatch on Beach 2 than would hatch on Beach 1? And would this benefit of moving the eggs outweigh the risks posed by other variables? 

To answer these questions, we must know the relationship between temperature and hatching success. Relationships enable us to predict how the value of an independent variable, such as temperature, affects the value of a dependent variable, such as hatching success.  
   
This relationship can be described by the following linear model:

**𝜇** \= *aT* \+ *b*

where *T* is the temperature (°C), **𝜇** is the mean (or expected) hatching success (%) for a given temperature, and *a* and *b* are the slope and intercept of the linear relationship between temperature and the mean hatching success. ***Note**: This linear model is the same as the one commonly used in algebra courses, where y \= ax \+ b, except that we are using the symbols T and* **𝜇** *instead of x and y, respectively.*

A linear model is an extension of a normal probability distribution in which the mean of the dependent variable depends on the value of the independent variable. As with any normal probability distribution, we can also calculate a standard deviation, which tells us our uncertainty about the mean. 

Microsoft Excel has functions for estimating the slope, intercept, and standard deviation of a linear model. 

To estimate the **slope**, use the *slope* function:  

\=slope(dependent observations, independent observations),

To estimate the **intercept**, use the *intercept* function:  

\=intercept(dependent observations, independent observations),

To estimate the **standard deviation**, use the *steyx* function:  

\=steyx(dependent observations, independent observations).

For example, consider the five pairs of observations in the spreadsheet below:

|  | A | B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | **Independent variable** | **Dependent variable** |
| 2 | 5 | 25 |
| 3 | 3 | 64 |
| 4 | 7 | 24 |
| 5 | 4 | 57 |
| 6 | 6 | 35 |

For these data, you would calculate the slope, intercept, and standard deviation of the linear relationship by entering the following functions in Excel:

Slope \=slope(B2:B6, A2:A6)

Intercept \=intercept(B2:B6, A2:A6)

Standard deviation \=steyx(B2:B6, A2:A6)

When specifying cells in the function, be sure to specify the columns for the variables in the correct order (dependent variable first, independent variable second). Also, be sure that the starting row and ending row of each variable spans all of the data. In this example, we would specify rows 2 through 6 because the data occur only in those rows. 

If we round to the nearest whole number, we should obtain the following values for slope, intercept, and standard deviation of the linear relationship in the example above:

Slope \=slope(B2:B6, A2:A6) \= **\-10**  
Intercept \=intercept(B2:B6, A2:A6) \= **92**  
   
Standard deviation \=steyx(B2:B6, A2:A6) \= **10**

**Directions**: For questions 2-9, refer to “Workbook: Scientific Reasoning Act II,” containing the mean temperature and hatching success in past breeding seasons (N \= 37 breeding seasons). Refer to tables 1 and 2\. Use Excel for calculations, modeling, and graphing. **Round all calculated values to the nearest tenth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.8.**

2. Create a plot of a linear relationship between the mean temperature and hatching success in past breeding seasons (in the box labeled “Graph 1”). This plot should follow the formatting guidelines listed below. 

   **Formatting Instructions**

* Chart type: X Y (Scatter)  
* Quick layout: Layout 1 \- Scatter  
* Y-axes title: “Hatching success (%)”  
* X-axis title: “Mean soil temperature (°C)”  
* X-axis Minimum Bound: 14  
* X-axis Maximum Bound: 22  
* Provide a trendline illustrating the relationship between the mean soil temperature and hatching success (Add chart element→linear trendline)  
    
3. In Table 1, calculate the slope of the linear relationship between the mean temperature and hatching success in past breeding seasons.   
     
   Slope \=

	

4. In Table 1, calculate the intercept of the linear relationship between the mean temperature and hatching success in past breeding seasons. 

	  
	Intercept \=

5. In Table 1, calculate the standard deviation of the linear relationship between the mean temperature and hatching success in past breeding seasons.  
     
   Standard deviation \=

Now that you know the slope of and intercept of the linear relationship, you can predict hatching success at any temperature. Specifically, we want to know the hatching success at the mean temperature of each beach. Therefore, we must first estimate the mean temperature of each beach. Then, we can enter the mean temperature as the independent variable (x) in our linear model and predict hatching success (y). 

6. In Table 2, calculate the mean temperature of Beach 1\. 

Mean temperature of Beach 1 \=

7. In Table 2, calculate the mean temperature of Beach 2\.   
   

Mean temperature of Beach 2 \=

Use the linear model to calculate the expected hatching success at the mean temperature of each beach (Excel tutorial [\#9 Analyzing Linear Relationships](https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/221276/pages/excel-tutorial-9); [\#9 Analyzing Linear Relationships transcript](https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/221276/files/113150235?wrap=1)). For example, assume that the relationship between temperature (*T*) and the expected hatching success (𝜇) is–

**𝜇** \= *aT* \+ b

where   
*a* \= 0.1% per °C 

*b* \= 2%

If the mean temperature of a beach were 10°C, you would calculate the expected hatching success as follows:

**𝜇** \= (0.1% °C\-1)(10°C) \+ 2%

   \= 1% \+ 2%

   \= 3%

**Directions**: For questions 8-9, use the linear relationship you modeled in questions 2-5 and the mean temperatures calculated in questions 6 and 7 to calculate the expected hatching success (𝝁) at the mean temperature of each beach (*T*). Express your answers as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest tenth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.8.**

## **Step 3: Weigh the evidence and conclude whether the mean temperature is better for astelar eggs on Beach 1 or Beach 2\.**

You are ready to answer the question “Would more astelars hatch at the mean temperature of Beach 1 or at the mean temperature of Beach 2?” Be sure to provide your reasoning, highlighting the relevant evidence supporting your claim.

10. Select the claim that is better supported by the evidence. 

    1. More astelars will hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 1 than at the mean temperature on Beach 2\.  
    2. More astelars will hatch at the mean temperature on Beach 2 than at the mean temperature on Beach 1\.

# **Appendix 2**

**Would more astelars hatch at the mean concentration of water and oxygen on Beach 1 or Beach 2?**

In addition to temperature, you measured the concentrations of water and oxygen at the two beaches. Now that we have quantified the thermal effects of moving the eggs to Beach 2 vs keeping them at Beach 1, we must determine whether the concentrations of oxygen or water at Beach 2 will be worse for astelars than the concentrations at Beach 1\. 

We will follow three steps to answer the question “Would more astelars hatch at the mean concentration of water (or oxygen) on Beach 1 or Beach 2?”:

**Step 1: Anticipate your analysis**: Determine what you should observe if the mean concentration of water (or oxygen) is better for astelar eggs on Beach 1 or Beach 2\. This step will help us identify the evidence needed to build an argument in Step 3\. 

**Step 2: Predict whether more astelars will hatch at the mean oxygen (or water) concentration of Beach 1 or at the mean oxygen (or water) concentration of Beach 2**: Use the oxygen (or water) concentrations of each beach to predict hatching success. First, we will use data for past breeding seasons to relate hatching success to the mean oxygen (or water) concentration. Then, we will estimate the mean oxygen (or water) concentration of each beach in the current breeding season. Finally, we will use this relationship to predict the hatching success in the current breeding season. This step provides the evidence needed to build an argument in Step 3, when we will conclude whether the mean oxygen (or water) concentration of Beach 1 or Beach 2 would enable more astelars to hatch.

To construct a sound argument, one must anticipate the evidence needed to support a claim. In Appendix 2, you can choose between two claims about oxygen concentration (or water concentration): 

1) more astelars will hatch at the mean oxygen concentration (or water concentration) on Beach 1 than at the mean oxygen concentration (or water concentration) on Beach 2; or 

2) more astelars will hatch at the mean oxygen concentration (or water concentration) on Beach 2 than at the mean oxygen concentration (or water concentration) on Beach 1\. 

To determine which claim is better supported, we must know the relationship between oxygen concentration (or water concentration) and hatching success. In this step, we will use our knowledge of linear relationships to anticipate the evidence needed to support each of the potential claims. Because similar types of evidence are needed to support a claim about oxygen concentration or water concentration, we will focus on oxygen concentration here.

On Earth, the concentrations of water and oxygen affect the hatching success of eggs. While you were measuring these variables on the two beaches, I used data from past breeding seasons to model the relationship between the mean water concentration of a nest and the hatching success of eggs. Similarly, I modeled the relationship between the mean oxygen concentration and the hatching success. 

Using these relationships, we can determine which beach has the physical conditions to enable more astelars to hatch. 

*Part 1: Oxygen concentration*

The plot below shows the relationship between oxygen concentration and hatching success. 

![This figure shows a scatter plot of the linear relationship between the mean soil oxygen concentration and hatching success of astelar eggs in past breeding seasons.The y-axis is a continuous variable - the hatching success of astelar eggs (%). The y-axis ranges from 50.0% to 100.0%. The x-axis is a continuous variable - the mean soil oxygen concentration of astelar nesting sites (%). The x-axis ranges from 13.00% to 13.80%. The unfilled circles represent individual x,y coordinates. The solid grey line is the linear model of the relationship between the mean soil oxygen concentration and hatching success of astelar eggs in past breeding seasons.The linear model shows that as the soil oxygen concentration increases, there is a small increase in hatching success.][image1]

Given the linear relationship above, you can predict hatching success at any oxygen concentration. Specifically, we want to know the expected hatching success at the mean oxygen concentration of each beach. Therefore, we must enter the mean oxygen as the independent variable in our linear model and predict the hatching success. 

Using the data you collected in the sanctuary, I estimated the mean and standard deviation of oxygen concentration for each beach:

* **Beach 1 has a mean oxygen concentration of 12.93% and a standard deviation of 0.46%.**

* **Beach 2 has a mean oxygen concentration of 11.97% and a standard deviation of 0.16%.**

**Directions**: For questions 12-13, refer to “Workbook: Scientific Reasoning Act II” and use the linear relationship to calculate the expected hatching success at the mean oxygen concentration of each beach in Table 3\. Express your answers as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest hundredth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.82**.

*Part 2: Water concentration*

The plot below shows the relationship between water concentration and hatching success.

The solid grey line is the linear model of the relationship between the mean soil water concentration and hatching success of astelar eggs in past breeding seasons.The linear model shows that there is little to no relationship between soil water concentration and hatching success of astelar eggs.][image2]

Having modeled the linear relationship between water concentration and hatching success and having estimated the slope, intercept, and standard deviation of this model, we are ready to figure out which beach, Beach 1 or Beach 2, will ultimately be better for the astelars’ developing offspring. 

To do this, we must estimate the expected hatching success at both beaches when given the mean nest site water concentration at each beach. Using the data you collected in the sanctuary, I estimated the mean and standard deviation of water concentration for each beach:

* **Beach 1 has a mean water concentration of 9.21% and a standard deviation of 0.86%.**

* **Beach 2 has a mean water concentration of 13.20% and a standard deviation of 2.05%.**

**Directions**: For questions 14-15, refer to “Workbook: Scientific Reasoning Act II” and use the linear relationship to calculate the expected hatching success at the mean water concentration of each beach in Table 4\. Express your answers as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest hundredth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.82.** For instructions about how to use a linear relationship to calculate the expected hatching success with a linear model, see Step 2 in Appendix 1 of this Mission Memo.

# **Appendix 3**

## **Considering the physical and biological conditions of each beach, should we leave the eggs at Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2?**

For the population of astelars to persist, at least 381 pups must survive each season. Given that 2217 eggs were laid this season, at least 17.2% of the astelars in these eggs must hatch and enter the sea. Because predators will eliminate some pups before they reach the sea, much more than 17.2% of the eggs must hatch for 17.2% of the pups to enter the sea. To be safe, we should aim for the greatest possible hatching success.

Thanks to your careful analysis, we know the expected hatching success at each beach, given the expected temperature, water concentration, and oxygen concentration. Now, we can use this information to decide whether hatching success would be greater under the physical conditions on Beach 1 or Beach 2\. 

Still, physical conditions are not the only variables that affect the survival of astelar eggs. Certain biological variables, such as the number of predators, are also important. A major predator of astelars, the red tippers, occur at both beaches. However, we discovered an additional threat at Beach 2—digworms. 

Digworms are large burrowing creatures that occur on Beach 2, but not on Beach 1\. Although digworms do not eat astelar eggs, a burrowing digworm can easily crush an astelar egg, killing the embryo inside. Consequently, our decision to move the astelars to Beach 2 should be informed by the potential impact of this biological variable on hatching success.

Follow these three steps to determine whether more astelars would hatch on Beach 1 or Beach 2:

**Step 1: Determine which physical variable has the greatest impact on hatching success:** You measured three physical variables—temperature, water, and oxygen—on each beach. Unfortunately, the linear model that you know how to build can only incorporate one independent variable. Therefore, you must choose the variable that has the greatest impact on hatching success. This step would enable us to decide how many eggs would survive the physical conditions of the beach, before we account for the impact of digworms in Step 2\.   
**Step 2: Determine how much the digworms will decrease hatching success on Beach 2:** Here, you will reduce the expected hatching success on Beach 2 to account for the impact of digworms. The hatching success for Beach 1 will remain the same as calculated in Step 1, because no digworms occur on this beach. This step provides the evidence needed to build an argument in Step 3, when we will answer the question “Should we leave the eggs on Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2?”

**Step 3: Weigh the evidence and conclude whether we should leave the astelars on Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2:** Construct an argument to answer the question “Should we leave the eggs at Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2?” Your argument will draw on your answers and calculations in Steps 1 and 2\.

In Appendices 1 and 2, you used a linear model to calculate the expected hatching success, given the value of a dependent variable (the mean temperature, water concentration, or oxygen concentration). Now, you must decide which of the three physical variables has the greatest impact on hatching success.

Given how curious humans can be you're probably wondering why we have to choose one of the physical variables. Why can't we use all of them? 

The answer illustrates the difference between reality and a model. In reality, the hatching success of astelar eggs depends on the temperature, oxygen concentration, *and* water concentration of the environment. In our model, however, we can only include one independent variable. For example, the independent variable on the x-axis of a linear model could be either temperature or oxygen concentration, but not both. Biologists have more complex models that deal with multiple independent variables; however, we haven't learned how to use such models yet. Therefore, we have to use a model that focuses on the most important variable.  

To identify the most important physical variable, let’s review the expected hatching successes that you calculated in Appendices 1 and 2\. 

19. **In Table 5 in the Excel workbook**, provide the expected hatching success for each beach given the mean temperature, water concentration, and oxygen concentrations, based on the linear model for each physical variable. **Recall that you calculated these values in Appendices 1 and 2, so refer back to these sections to complete the table.** Express your answers as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest tenth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.8.**  

As the table in question 19 shows, we know the expected hatching success for each physical variable measured at the two beaches. Now, we must choose one of these variables to consider when deciding how the physical environment will affect hatching success. 

How should we decide which physical variable has the greatest impact on hatching success? The answer is simple...subtraction\! 

For each variable, subtract the expected hatching success on Beach 1 from the expected hatching success on Beach 2\. That will tell you how different we expect the hatching success would be between the two beaches. The most important variable is the one that would cause the greatest difference in expected hatching success between beaches. 

For example, imagine two beaches called Beach A and Beach B. The mean temperature of Beach A is 11 °C, and the mean temperature of Beach B is 13 °C.

Furthermore, assume that the linear relationship between temperature (*T*) and the expected hatching success (𝜇) is

𝜇 \= *aT* \+ *b*

where the slope (*a*) equals 1.2% per °C, and the intercept (*b*) equals 100%. 

Using this linear model, the expected hatching success at Beach A (𝜇A) would be

 𝜇A \= (-1.2% per °C) (11°C) \+ 100%

      \= 84.4%

and the expected hatching success at Beach B (𝜇B) would be 

𝜇B \= (-1.2% per °C) (13°C) \+ 100%

    \= 86.8%

To summarize, we should expect 84.4% of eggs to hatch on Beach A and 86.8% of eggs to hatch on Beach B. 

Therefore, the difference in hatching success between beaches would be 84.4 \- 86.8% \= \-2.4%

Because we are interested in the magnitude of the difference in hatching success (rather than its sign, positive or negative), we need to take the absolute value of the difference. To obtain the absolute value of a number, you convert a negative value to a positive one. For example, a value of \-2.4% becomes an absolute value of 2.4%. 

The absolute value of a positive number is the same number. Therefore, if the value were 2.4%, the absolute value would also be 2.4%. Likewise, the absolute value of 0% would be 0%. 

**Directions**: Use the hatching successes that you stated in question 19 (above) to answer questions 20-22. Express your answer as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest tenth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 3.8.** 

20. Calculate the absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean temperature of each beach (Table 6).    
      
    Absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean temperature of each beach \=

	

21. Calculate the absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean oxygen concentration at each beach (Table 6).

    Absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean oxygen concentration at each beach \=

22. Calculate the absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean water concentration at each beach (Table 6).

    Absolute value of the difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2 caused by the mean water concentration at each beach \=

Remember \- we want to select the physical variable that has the greatest impact on the expected hatching success. Select the variable that would cause the greatest absolute difference in expected hatching success between the two beaches. 

23. Which physical variable has the greatest impact on the expected hatching success?

    1. Temperature  
    2. Oxygen concentration  
    3. Water concentration 

## **Step 2: Determine how much the digworms will decrease hatching success on Beach 2\.**

Now that we’ve determined the impact of physical variables on hatching success, we're ready to consider the impact of a major biological variable—the presence of digworms. 

An adult digworm can easily crush an astelar egg while burrowing through the sand. **Based on my simulations, an astelar egg on Beach 2 would have a 27% chance of being crushed by a digworm before hatching. An astelar egg on Beach 1 has a 0% chance of being crushed by a digworm, because no digworms occur on Beach 1\.**

Clearly, the presence of digworms will decrease hatching success at Beach 2\. But would the benefit of a lower mean temperature of Beach 2 more than compensate for the presence of digworms? In other words, should we expect a greater hatching success at Beach 2 despite the presence of digworms? 

To answer this question, we need to calculate hatching success at each beach in a way that accounts for two independent processes: 

1) surviving the physical conditions at the beach (temperature, oxygen, or water), and   
2) surviving the biological conditions at the beach (the burrowing of digworms).

Let's return to our example of Beach A and Beach B from Step 1 (see above). In this example, the expected hatching success at the temperature of Beach A was 84.4% and the expected hatching success at the temperature of Beach B was 86.8%. 

Now, let's assume that no digworms occur at Beach A, but some digworms occur at Beach B. Given the absence of digworms at Beach A, the probability of a digworm crushing an astelar egg at Beach A equals 0%. However, the presence of digworms at Beach B means that probability of a digworm crushing an astelar egg at Beach B equals 15%, which means the probability of surviving the borrowing of digworms equals 100% \- 15%, or 85%. 

How would we calculate the probability that an astelar survives both the temperature of the beach *and* the burrowing of digworms? The key is that these two events occur independently of each other; in other words, the probability of surviving a certain temperature does not depend on the probability of surviving the burrowing of digworms. 

If we want to know the probability that two independent events occur together, we use the **product rule of probability**. According to the product rule, the probability of two independent events occurring together, abbreviated as P(A and B), equals the product of the probabilities of these events:  
   
P(A and B)=P(A)∙P(B)

Applying the product rule to our example, we can calculate the probability of an astelar hatching on Beach A as follows:

P(A and B) \= (84.4%)·(100%) \= 84%

in which we multiply the probability of surviving the temperature at Beach A (84.4%) by the probability of surviving digworms (100%, because no digworms occur on Beach A).

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of an astelar hatching on Beach B as follows:

P(A and B) \= (86.8%)·(85%) \= 74%

in which we multiply the probability of surviving the temperature at Beach B (86.8%) by the probability of surviving digworms (85%, because digworms occur on Beach B and have a 15% chance of crushing an astelar egg).

Although we chose temperature as the physical variable in this example, you should choose whichever physical variable would cause the greatest difference in hatching success between Beach 1 and Beach 2\.

The probability of two or more events occurring together is referred to as a **joint probability**. Using the product rule, calculate the joint probability that an astelar hatches as the product of two independent probabilities: 

1) the probability that an astelar survives the mean temperature, oxygen concentration, or water concentration of the beach (predicted with the linear model in Appendix 1 or 2 relating the most important physical variable to hatching success); and   
2) the probability that an astelar survives the burrowing of digworms **(assumed to be 100% for Beach 1 and 73% for Beach 2\)**. 

**Directions**: In Table 7 of the Excel workbook, use the product rule of probability to answer questions 24-25. Express your answers as a percentage (%). **Round all calculated values to the nearest whole number. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 4\.** 

24. Calculate the joint probability that an astelar egg will hatch on Beach 1, accounting for the impact of the most important physical variable (temperature, oxygen, or water) and the impact of digworms.

## **Step 3: Weigh the evidence and conclude whether we should leave the astelars on Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2\.**

Thanks to your efforts in Step 2 of Appendix 3, we are now ready to answer the question “Should leave the astelars on Beach 1 or move them to Beach 2?” Be sure to provide your reasoning, highlighting the relevant evidence supporting your claim. 

Remember that our decision should be based on the joint probability you calculated in Step 2 of Appendix 3 that an astelar hatches on Beach 1 and Beach 2 given: 1\) the probability that an astelar survives the mean temperature, oxygen concentration, *or* water concentration of the beach (predicted with the linear model in Appendix 1 or 2 relating the most important physical variable to hatching success); and 2\) the probability that an astelar survives the burrowing of digworms (assumed to be 100% for Beach 1 and 73% for Beach 2).

26. Select the claim that is better supported by the evidence. 

    1. We should leave the astelars on Beach 1  
    2. We should move the astelars to Beach 2

27. Summarize the evidence that supports the claims you selected in question 26\. Be sure to include how you determined which beach we should move the astelars to, whether beach 1 or beach 2\. You must provide quantitative evidence where applicable.
