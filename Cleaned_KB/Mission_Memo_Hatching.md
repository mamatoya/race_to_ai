# **Final Assignment**

## **Background**

A **population** is a group of organisms of the same species that live in a particular geographic location. For example, people living in the city of Phoenix are considered a population of humans. 

Biologists estimate the number of organisms in a population (population size) to know whether a species has become too rare or too abundant. Knowing a population's size also enables biologists to manage the resources needed to sustain the population. For example, biologists have estimated how many people will live in Phoenix during the next 40 years to know whether the current water supply will support the future population. **A population grows when the number of organisms born exceeds the number that die. Conversely, a population shrinks when the number of organisms that die exceeds the number born.** If the population of humans in Phoenix grows from one year to the next, the number of people born must have exceeded the number of people who died. 

**Growth rate** is a measure of how a population’s size changes over time. A **positive growth rate** means that the population size increases over time (i.e., the population grows). A **negative growth rate** means that the population size decreases over time (i.e., the population shrinks). A **growth rate of zero** means that the population size does not change over time (i.e., the population neither grows nor shrinks, but remains stable). Population size increases from year to year if its growth rate is greater than 0\. For example, if the growth rate for Phoenix for the last 10 years were 0.16, the population size would have increased by 16% (a mean of 1.6% per year). If the nearby town of Sierra Vista experienced a growth rate of \-0.05 during the same period, its population size decreased by 5% over 10 years (a mean of \-0.5% per year).  
 

The growth of a population depends on many variables, including the abundance of food. Organisms rely on the matter and energy in food to survive and reproduce. Predators, such mice (see figure above), consume other organisms as food, referred to as prey. **Prey density** is the number of prey living in an area. The greater the prey density, the more prey exist in an area. A population of predators requires a sufficient prey density to persist over time.    

## **Scenario**

The National Park Service has monitored two populations of locally endangered mice for 50 years. Biologists for the park service measured the growth rate and prey density of each population from 1971 to 2021\. Their goal was to ensure that the mouse populations persist for many years to come. 

Recently, the National Park Service was allocated funds by Congress to protect this species of mice. Unfortunately, the new budget is sufficient to protect only one of the two populations. The biologists read studies about interventions to save similar species of rodents and concluded that increasing the prey density would be a simple yet effective strategy to protect these mice.

The biologists need to determine which population they should supply with additional prey. Naturally, they wanted to invest their resources in the population that is *growing more slowly* in 2021 (in other words, does not have a positive growth rate in 2021 or, if both have negative growth rates \- the population that has the lower growth rate). **Your job is to recommend which population the biologists should protect and to determine how much prey must be added to stabilize the population.**

To complete this assignment, you should follow the sequence of steps below:

**Step 1:** Anticipate your analysis.

**Step 2:** Model the relationship between prey density and growth rate during the past 50 years.

**Step 3:** Estimate the typical prey density for each population during the past 50 years

**Step 4:** Calculate the expected growth rate for each population during a year given its typical prey density.

**Step 5:** Weigh the evidence and decide which population should be protected this year.

## **Step 1: Anticipate your analysis.** 

In each of the figures below (A-C), the y-axis represents the growth rate of a population of mice. Growth rate is a continuous variable, with values greater than zero indicating a positive growth rate and values less than zero indicating a negative growth rate. The x-axis represents the density of prey hunted by mice. Prey density is a continuous variable, with higher values indicating greater prey density. The solid black line represents a hypothetical linear model of the relationship between prey density and growth rate of the mouse populations. The mean prey density for each population of mice is marked by an arrow pointing to the x-axis. 

This figure shows a scatter plot with a linear model (trendline), however the individual data points have been removed, so only the trendline remains. The y-axis is a continuous variable - the growth rate of owl populations (owls/year). Growth rates greater than zero indicate a postive growth rate, meaning the population is growing. Growth rates less than zero indicate a negative growth rate, meaning the population is shrinking. Growth rates equal to zero indicate no growth, meaning the population is neither growing or shrinking - instead it is stable in size. The x-axis is a continuous variable - the prey density in areas where owl populations are found (prey/km^2). Larger values indicate more prey are present in a given area. Lower values indicate fewer prey are present in a given area. The solid black line represents a hypothetical linear model of the relationship between prey density and the growth rate of owl populations. Excel refers to this as a trendline.The mean prey density of two owl populations, Population 1 and Population 2, are marked by separate arrows pointing to the x-axis.  The mean prey density of Population 1 is lower than the mean prey density of Population 2. The linear model (trendline) of the relationship between prey density and the growth rate of owl populations shows there is no relationship between prey density and growth rate.This figure shows a scatter plot with a linear model (trendline), however the individual data points have been removed, so only the trendline remains.

1. Select the figure that best illustrates the pattern that one should observe **if the biologists thought they should invest their resources into Population 1 instead of Population 2**. 

   1. Figure A  
   2. Figure B  
   3. Figure C

2. Explain your answer to the previous question. Why did you choose one figure over the others? What criteria were you using? 

## **Step 2: Model the relationship between prey density and growth rate during the past 50 years.**

**Directions:** For questions 3-7, download the Excel file titled, “Data: Mouse Population Growth and Prey Density,” containing the prey densities and growth rates of both populations from 1971 to 2020 (sample size \= 50 years). Use Excel for calculations, modeling, and graphing. Round all calculated values to the nearest ten-thousandth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.821853, round to 3.8219.

3. Create a single plot of a linear relationship between the prey density and the growth rate of both populations during 1971 to 2020\. This plot should follow the formatting guidelines listed below.

4. Based on the figure that you made in question 3, describe the relationship between prey density and growth rate. In other words, how does growth rate change as prey density changes?

**Directions:** Do your calculations for questions 5-7 in Table 1 of the Excel workbook.  Round all calculated values to the nearest ten-thousandth of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.821853, round to 3.8219.

5. Calculate the slope of the linear relationship between prey density and growth rate during the past 50 years. 

   Slope \=

7. Calculate the standard deviation\* of the linear relationship between the prey density and the growth rate during the past 50 years. 

   \*When working with data in Excel and calculating measures of variability like standard deviation, it is important to choose the appropriate function based on the nature of your data.

   **Single Variable/Column**

   If you're dealing with only one variable or column of data, you'll use the '=STDEV' function.

   **Dependent AND Independent Variables**

   When you have both a dependent and independent variable and are interested in calculating the standard deviation of the predicted y-values for a given x, you'll use the '=STEYX' function.

   

   Standard deviation \=

   

## **Step 3: Estimate the typical prey density for each population during the past 50 years.**

**Mean and Median Refresher**  
**Mean:** The mean, often called the average, is the most commonly used measure of a central tendency. 

**When to use the mean:**

* The mean is particularly useful when dealing with data that is evenly distributed and lacks extreme outliers.  
* It gives equal weight to all data points.

**Median**: The median is the middle value of a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.

**When to use the median:** 

* The median is especially useful when dealing with skewed distributions or extreme outliers.  
* It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean.

In summary, while the mean and median are measures of central tendency, they have different strengths and weaknesses. Understanding when to use each measure is crucial in accurately interpreting and analyzing data. 

*Part 1: Population A*

**Directions:** For questions 8-13 in the Excel workbook, refer to the data” containing the prey densities of Population A from 1971 to 2020 (sample size \= 50 years).

*Part 2: Population B*

**Directions:** For questions 14-19 in the Excel workbook, refer to the data containing the prey densities of Population B from 1971 to 2020 (sample size \= 50 years). Use Excel for calculations, modeling, and graphing. Round all calculated values to the nearest whole number. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.8218, round to 4\. 

14. Calculate the mean prey density of Population B from 1971 to 2020 (Excel Table 3).

    Median prey density of Population B from 1971 to 2020 \=  
      
17. Does a normal probability distribution reasonably model the prey density of Population B from 1971 to 2020? Explain your answer. Be sure to discuss the assumptions of a normal probability distribution and why these assumptions seem appropriate (or not) for modeling the prey density of Population B from 1971 to 2020\. 

18. The biologists want to know what the typical or expected prey density of Population B was from 1971 to 2020\. Which value best represents the typical or expected prey density of Population B from 1971 to 2020, the mean or the median prey density?

19. Justify your answer to question 18\. 

## **Step 4: Calculate the expected growth rate for each population during a year given its typical prey density.**

*Part 1: Population A*

**Directions:** For questions 20-23, use your downloaded workbook and refer to Table 4 for calculations. 

20. Calculate the expected growth rate of Population A given its mean prey density. Round all final calculated values to the nearest ten-thousandths of a decimal place. For example, if you calculate the value as 3.821853, round to 3.8219. *Do not round intermediate calculations.* 

    Expected growth rate for Population A given its mean prey density \=

    

    

    

21. At the typical prey density Population A experiences, is Population A growing, shrinking, or staying the same?

    1. Growing  
    2. Shrinking  
    3. Staying the same

*Part 2: Population B*

22. Calculate the expected growth rate for Population B given the typical prey density of Population B.  **Round all final calculated values to the nearest ten-thousandths of a decimal place.** For example, if you calculate the value as 3.821853, round to 3.8219. *Do not round intermediate calculations.*

    Expected growth rate for Population B given the typical prey density of Population B \=

    

    

23. At the typical prey density Population B experiences, is Population B growing, shrinking, or staying the same?

    1. Growing  
    2. Shrinking  
    3. Staying the same

## **Step 5: Weigh the evidence and decide which population should be protected this year.**

24. Which population(s), if any, is/are at risk of disappearing entirely if the biologists do not intervene?  Assume two things when answering this question. First, assume that prey densities for both populations equal the typical prey densities that you calculated in Step 3\. Second, assume that the relationship between prey density and growth rate remains the same as the relationship that you modeled in Step 2\. 

    1. Population A is at risk of disappearing  
    2. Population B is at risk of disappearing  
    3. Both populations are at risk of disappearing  
    4. Neither population is at risk of disappearing

25\. Explain your answer to question 24\. 

Recall that the biologists want to add prey to the population that is growing more slowly (in other words, does not have a positive growth rate in 2021 or, if both have negative growth rates \- the population that has the lower growth rate) in 2021 based on their respective typical prey densities and the relationship between prey density and growth rate. Use your answers to the previous questions to answer the question: “To which population should the biologists supply with additional prey?”

26\. Select the claim that is better supported by the evidence. 

1. The biologists should add prey to Population A  
   2. The biologists should add prey to Population B

   27\. Summarize the evidence that supports your claim. Use quantitative evidence when possible. Your evidence should minimally address the biologists criteria \- that the biologists want to add prey to the population that is growing more slowly in 2021 based on their respective typical prey densities and the relationship between prey density and growth rate.

Now that you have helped the biologists determine which population to give additional prey, the remaining question is how much prey should the biologists add. The biologists are concerned that adding too little prey would fail to enable the population to grow, but adding too much prey would waste money that could be used for other projects. After some debate, the biologists have narrowed their choices to the following prey densities: 17458 prey/km2, 19318 prey/km2, 22109 prey/km2, or 25829 prey/km2.

Although the biologists disagree on the target prey density, they agreed on a goal. Specifically, they want to add enough prey to raise the prey density to a value that would have an 80% chance of causing a positive growth rate.

Once again, you must help the biologists by recommending how much prey should be added. Use your linear model of the relationship between prey density and population growth to recommend a target prey density that meets the biologists' goal.

28\. Select the prey density that best matches the goals the biologists stated in the paragraphs above. 

*Hint: Given the predicted prey densities to choose from,you will finally calculate the probabilities and select the one that will give \>80% chance of causing a positive growth rate.*  

*Step 1\.  Calculate the expected growth rate using using the linear relationship from Question 3*

*Step 2\.  Using the growth rate calculated for each of the prey densities, calculate the probabilities the growth rate is \> 0*

1. 17458 prey/km2  
   2. 19318 prey/km2  
   3. 22109 prey/km2  
   4. 25829 prey/km2
